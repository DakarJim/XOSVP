# Xbox Open Source Video Project
XOSVP is an alternative, open-source solution to the Microsoft HD AV Pack. The XOSVP strives to produce the absolute best analog video quality out of your original xbox.

## What is it?
Read a full indepth rundown on what XOSVP is and why it exists on [my blog](https://blog.dtho.mp/2018/12/15/xosvp-intro/).

## Schematics
In this repo are the schematics, net file, foot prints, and PCB design for the XOSVP.

All of these were designed in KiCad 5, and I highly recommend you use KiCad to work with these files.

## Enclosure
Also within this repo is a 3D printable enclosure for the XOSVP. It is designed for friction fit so please ensure your 3D printer is calibrated properly before printing.

The enclosure was designed with Tinkercad, and you can view this design [HERE](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6Rlx4JstT6S-xosvp-enclosure-v3).

## License
I want high quality analog video from the original xbox to be available to everyone, which is why I open sourced this project. Everything within this repo is covered by [CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2](/LICENSE).
